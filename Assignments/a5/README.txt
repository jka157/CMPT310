Pick 1 to play against the computer that uses random playout.
Pick 2 to have the modified Monte-Carlo tree search heuristic play against the random playout from option 1.

Option 1:

Need to select integers from 0-63 corresponding to the board.
If an invalid move is made, the board will check the possible moves and display a board with circles that show the possible moves.
If a valid move is inputted, you will see an updated board and the computer will make it's random move with the updated board will be shown.
The game will continue until both sides can't make a move or the board is filled.

Option 2:

The simulation will be done automatically the user just needs to observe the moves made.
The program will stop for the user to see the move that has been made.
The user needs to press Enter to continue.

The opposing computer will make its random move.
After that the board will be updated and the user can press Enter again to pass on the program to the simulation.

*If you don't want to see each move, comment out the cin.ignore() on lines (1167 & 1194)
